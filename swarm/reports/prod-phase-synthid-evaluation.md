# Prod-Phase Evaluation: Google SynthID for Credity Evidence Authentication

Date: 2026-02-21
Owner lane: credity-synthid-eval-lane
Scope: Evidence authentication use case (NOT identity verification)

## Executive recommendation

**Recommendation: Integrate SynthID as an optional evidence-risk signal for media uploads (image/video), not as a primary authenticity gate.**

- Use it in **claims/evidence upload flow** (`POST /api/v1/evidence/upload`) as a supplemental check.
- Do **not** block claims solely because SynthID is absent.
- Keep current controls (metadata/EXIF checks, deepfake checks, timeline consistency, anchoring) as primary.
- Ship behind feature flags and vendor-availability guardrails.

---

## What we verified

### 1) Product fit for Credity evidence use

SynthID is designed to identify content generated by Google AI systems and is most useful when the watermark is present by design.

Practical implication for Credity:
- Good at flagging some AI-generated media in claims evidence streams.
- Not suitable as a universal detector for arbitrary uploaded documents and all non-Google generators.
- Better as a **"positive signal when detected"** than a **"negative signal when absent."**

### 2) API feasibility (current state)

Observed public docs/signals:
- Vertex/Imagen docs indicate generated images are watermarked by default, with watermark controls in generation APIs.
- DeepMind SynthID page describes watermarking and identification behavior across modalities.
- Broadly consumable, stable public detector API for third-party arbitrary intake appears limited/unclear for production hard dependency.

**Feasibility verdict:**
- **Generation-side watermarking: feasible and documented** (for Google-generated assets).
- **Detector-side external integration: feasible only as best-effort adapter, not guaranteed hard dependency today.**

## Where to use in Credity

## A) Immediate placement (recommended)

`BlockWalletDigi/server/routes/claims.ts`
- Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/evidence/upload`
- Service: `server/services/evidence-analysis.ts`

Add SynthID assessment as one field in `analysisDetails` and include in persisted `analysisData`.

## B) Not recommended as primary gate

- Identity/KYC verification decisions
- Credential validity checks
- Hard reject of claims solely due to SynthID absence

---

## Privacy / compliance implications (India DPDP + global posture)

1. **Purpose limitation**
   - Use only for fraud/evidence integrity risk assessment.

2. **Data minimization**
   - Prefer sending URL references or derived artifacts to detector services.
   - Avoid shipping full PII-heavy documents to third-party detection until DPA/legal basis is complete.

3. **User disclosure + consent**
   - Explain AI-assisted evidence screening in privacy notice and claims flow terms.

4. **Storage and retention**
   - Persist only verdict/confidence/reason; avoid retaining external provider raw payloads unless needed for audit.

5. **Cross-border transfer guardrail**
   - If external detector endpoints are used, confirm transfer/legal controls before enabling in production.

## Fallback strategy

When detector is unavailable or unsupported:
- Return `synthid.verdict = unavailable|unsupported`.
- Continue pipeline with existing checks:
  - EXIF/metadata consistency
  - manipulation heuristics
  - deepfake service verdict
  - timeline and claim coherence
  - hash/anchor records

Decision policy:
- `watermark_detected`: increase fraud suspicion for AI-origin media (context-dependent), but still human-review when high value.
- `not_detected`: no positive authenticity guarantee; keep neutral.
- `unavailable/unsupported`: no penalty by default.

---

## Phased rollout plan

### Phase 0 (now, done in repo)
- Add adapter stub and tests.
- Wire into evidence-analysis output as non-blocking metadata.

### Phase 1 (internal pilot)
- Enable on low-risk cohorts with feature flag.
- Capture operational telemetry:
  - detection coverage by media type
  - timeout/error rates
  - correlation with confirmed fraud outcomes

### Phase 2 (risk-weighted scoring)
- Introduce calibrated weighting in fraud score model.
- Add reviewer console explanation text ("SynthID detected / unavailable / unsupported").

### Phase 3 (enterprise hardening)
- Legal review + DPA + region constraints.
- SLO/SLA, retries, queueing, circuit breaker.
- Optional provider abstraction for alternative watermark/C2PA detectors.

## Code changes made

### 1) New service adapter (stub)
- `BlockWalletDigi/server/services/synthid-adapter.ts`

Key behavior:
- `document` => `unsupported`
- no endpoint => `unavailable`
- optional endpoint/API key timeout-based POST
- accepts normalized verdicts:
  - `watermark_detected`
  - `not_detected`
  - `unsupported`

### 2) Integration point
- Updated `BlockWalletDigi/server/services/evidence-analysis.ts`
- Adds `analysisDetails.synthId` (non-breaking optional field)

### 3) Tests
- `BlockWalletDigi/tests/synthid-adapter.test.ts`
  - endpoint missing fallback
  - document unsupported path
  - valid detector response parsing

### 4) Supporting doc
- `docs/plans/synthid-evidence-adapter.md`

## Final go/no-go

**GO (guarded):** adopt SynthID as an optional signal in evidence upload pipeline now.

**NO-GO for now:** making SynthID a mandatory, sole, or hard-block authenticity control.

This gives Credity immediate integration readiness while preserving reliability, compliance, and model-risk discipline.
