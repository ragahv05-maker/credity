## 2024-10-23 - CredVerseRecruiter Bulk Verify UX
**Learning:** Verified frontend changes in a complex auth-walled app by mocking API responses in Playwright, avoiding full backend setup.
**Action:** Use `page.route` to mock API endpoints for UI testing when backend is complex.

## 2024-10-23 - CredVerseRecruiter Sidebar Asset
**Learning:** Found and fixed a build-breaking missing image asset (`minimalist_abstract_logo_for_credverse.png`) by replacing it with a lucide-react icon (`ShieldCheck`).
**Action:** Always check for build errors in `npm run dev` logs even if static analysis passes.

## 2024-10-23 - CredVerseRecruiter InputGroup Component
**Learning:** Found an existing but unused `InputGroup` component in `@/components/ui/input-group` that supports button addons for inputs and textareas, avoiding custom CSS.
**Action:** Always search for existing UI components (`grep -r "Component"`) before implementing custom styles.

## 2024-10-25 - Tooltip Accessibility in BlockWalletDigi
**Learning:** Found that `shadcn/ui` Tooltip implementation requires both `TooltipTrigger` and `TooltipContent` to function correctly and remain accessible.
**Action:** When adding tooltips to icon-only buttons, always wrap them in `TooltipTrigger` and provide descriptive `TooltipContent` for screen readers and hover states.

## 2024-10-25 - Dependency Security (Minimatch)
**Learning:** High-severity ReDoS vulnerabilities in `minimatch` (<9.0.6 or <10.2.2) blocked CI. `npm audit fix` successfully patched these by updating nested dependencies in `package-lock.json`.
**Action:** Regularly run `npm audit` in each package directory and prioritize fixing High/Critical vulnerabilities to prevent CI blockage.
## 2023-10-25 - Icon-only buttons lacking tooltips and aria-labels
**Learning:** Found that multiple icon-only buttons in the application header (Theme Toggle, Notifications, Help, User Menu, Copy Address) were missing `aria-label` and `title` attributes, severely impacting screen reader accessibility and making the UX less intuitive since hovering didn't provide any context on their purpose.
**Action:** Always ensure any icon-only `<Button>` component includes a `title` (for mouse hover tooltips) and an `aria-label` (for screen readers). Adding native `title` attributes alongside `aria-label` is an efficient alternative to heavy tooltip components when working under strict line limits.
